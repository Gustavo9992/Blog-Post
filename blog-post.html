              <h1>Red Notice</h1>

              <h3>"Red Notice" has the polished feel of something concocted in a lab for maximum social-media attention (Dwayne Johnson! Ryan Reynolds! Gal Gadot!), then pieced together Frankenstein-style from parts of other movies. Yet the net effect is mildly enjoyable, creating a throwback caper film that showcases its stars doing what they do best, or rather for which they're best known.</h3>

              <h3>Written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (who teamed with Johnson, whose company produced the film, on "Central Intelligence" and "Skyscraper"), "Red Notice"borrows unabashedly from other films but doesn't appear the least bit red-faced or apologetic about it. There's the mismatched cop-thief pairing from "48 Hrs.," the party sequence from "True Lies," the clue-solving from "National Treasure," and so on.</h3>

             <h3>Any movie that jokes about the sought-after loot being a MacGuffin, a reference to Alfred Hitchcock's name for whatever priceless artifact set his plots in motion, or has Reynolds whistle the "Raiders of the Lost Ark" march clearly isn't taking itself too seriously.</h3>

                     <h3>By: Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson</h3>
                     <h4>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson was born into a professional wrestling family in 1972. An injury ended his college football career, so he entered the ring with the WWE. As "The Rock," he famously feuded with wrestler Steve Austin and won the WWE Heavyweight title numerous times. Johnson then parlayed his wrestling fame into a film career, appearing in projects like 2001's The Mummy Returns and 2010's Tooth Fairy. Later projects include the HBO series Ballers and leading roles in The Fast and the Furious and Jumanji franchises and the voice as demigod Maui in Moana.</h4>
